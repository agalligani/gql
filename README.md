GQL (a poor name for this repo) is an attempt to create a template for a React-based front-end app for a Drupal GQL backend.

I hope to provide more details in the future so bear with me. Essentially as of this writing there are functions that provide queries and mutations that operate on a Drupal 8 based install with the Graph QL module along with some custom mutations and mostly standard queries.

The focus now is on taxonomies and providing standard methods of querying them. 

There will be an accompanying repo that will include a Drupal 8 (or 9?) template to provide a matching backend set of tools and modules to dovetail with the React App frontend. 

The idea is to provide a React/Redux/Bootstrap/GQL App template where pieces such as the NAV, Routing, Styles and other aspects can be customized whilst utilizing a standard set of components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
